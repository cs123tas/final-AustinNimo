Update Generator::processXRule
Currently processFwdRule supports format (float, float, float) for distance, radius, length
	want to allow using the saved variable and also division, mult, addition, substraction, random numbers, sin, cos.
processRotRule supports format (float, float, float) angle of rotation
	want to allow using the saved variable and also division, mult, addition, substraction, random numbers, sin, cos.
processLeafRule supports format (float, float, float, float, float) for size, r, g, b, a
	want to allow using the saved variable and also division, mult, addition, substraction, random numbers, sin, cos.
processPredRule supports format (string) for which variable to use, currently inactive since nothing supports dividing.
	want to allow updating the variable for the next layer

The axiom MUST be named L.
	
Example:
L(g)->
  fwd(5.0, 1.0)
  rot(1.0, 2.0, 1.0)
  L(g)
  rot(-1.0, -2.0, -1.0)
  fwd(5.0, 1.0)
  leaf(1.5, 0.1, 0.9, 0.1, 1.0);
  
Next work to do: work on brackets and then + - * / and then variables and then randomization


Load Phong Shader in and paint each of the cylinders being made.

Perception and capabilitty
situational awareness



Break down until innermost parenthesis, then get a value, then replace it in the string and repeat

Integrate https://libraries.io/github/cparse/cparse and then set up the layers properly to use it.
Then paint properly
There's some sort of error with the last cylinder
** By Sunday
then add leaves
then add color
then add randomness
Then add texture


Bug in rotation and movement
L(g)->
  fwd(  0.0, 0.95, 0.2)
  fwd(  0.0, 0.95, 0.2)
  fwd(  0.0, 0.95, 0.2)
  fwd(  0.0, 0.95, 0.2)
  fwd(  0.0, 0.95, 0.2)
  fwd(  0.0, 0.95, 0.2)
  fwd(  0.0, 0.95, 0.2)
  fwd(  0.0, 0.95, 0.2)
  fwd(  0.0, 0.95, 0.2)

  How it should work:
  Maintain current starting location, vector angle facing, radius/
  On rotate: Rotate current vector angle facing
  On leaf: draw a leaf TBD
  On forward: draw at current location by applying current scaling, ten rotationg, then translating, change current location by moving the length in the direction of angle facing
