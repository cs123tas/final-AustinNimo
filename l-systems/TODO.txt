Update Generator::processXRule
Currently processFwdRule supports format (float, float, float) for distance, radius, length
	want to allow using the saved variable and also division, mult, addition, substraction, random numbers, sin, cos.
processRotRule supports format (float, float, float) angle of rotation
	want to allow using the saved variable and also division, mult, addition, substraction, random numbers, sin, cos.
processLeafRule supports format (float, float, float, float, float, float, float) for length, width, thickness, r, g, b, a
	want to allow using the saved variable and also division, mult, addition, substraction, random numbers, sin, cos.
processPredRule supports format (string) for which variable to use, currently inactive since nothing supports dividing.
	want to allow updating the variable for the next layer
	
	
vec(float vecX, float vecY, float vecZ, float vecPercent from 0 to 1 of how much to move towards this vector
new vector is normalize(vecPercent * vec + ((1 - vecPercent) * currentVec))

random(float startNumber: float endNumber)
Returns a random value between the two numbers
Note the middle is a colon
The axiom MUST be named L.
	
Example:
L(g)->
  fwd(5.0, 1.0)
  rot(1.0, 2.0, 1.0)
  L(g)
  rot(-1.0, -2.0, -1.0)
  fwd(5.0, 1.0)
  leaf(1.5, 0.1, 0.9, 0.1, 1.0);
  
Next work to do: work on brackets and then + - * / and then variables and then randomization


Load Phong Shader in and paint each of the cylinders being made.

Perception and capabilitty
situational awareness



Break down until innermost parenthesis, then get a value, then replace it in the string and repeat

L(g)->
  fwd(  0.0, 0.95, 0.2)
  fwd(  0.0, 0.95, 0.2)
  fwd(  0.0, 0.95, 0.2)
  fwd(  0.0, 0.95, 0.2)
  fwd(  0.0, 0.95, 0.2)
  fwd(  0.0, 0.95, 0.2)
  fwd(  0.0, 0.95, 0.2)
  fwd(  0.0, 0.95, 0.2)
  fwd(  0.0, 0.95, 0.2)
  L(g+1)

Scarlet Maple
  leaf(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.694, 0.133, 0.180, 1.0)

Split up who did what

Tree Designs I want to make
Pine
Oak	Summer/Fall/Winter
Scarlet Maple
Sakura

  How it should work:
  Maintain current starting location, vector angle facing, radius/
  On rotate: Rotate current vector angle facing
  On leaf: draw a leaf TBD
  On forward: draw at current location by applying current scaling, ten rotationg, then translating, change current location by moving the length in the direction of angle facing
